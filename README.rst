bfieldtools is a software package for magnetic field modeling with an emphasis on magnetic field generated by a continuous surface-current density. The surface-current density is described by a piecewise linear stream function on a triangle mesh.

The software currently features
 - Discrete calculus on triangle meshes, including the Laplacian, gradient, divergence and curl
 - Mesh operators (matrices) for inductance and resistance
 - Magnetic field as well as scalar and vector potentials of surface-current densities
 - Magnetic field as well as scalar and vector potentials of polyline currents
 - Spherical harmonics (multipole) representation of the magnetic field
 - Surface harmonics (Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions) for series expansion of the stream function
 - Coil design using convex optimization
 - Magnetic thermal noise of thin conductors
