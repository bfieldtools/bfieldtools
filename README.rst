bfieldtools
===========
bfieldtools is a set of tools for magnetic field modelling with emphasis on magnetic field generated by continuous surface current density. The surface current density is decribed by a piecewise linear stream function on a triangle mesh.

The toolbox currently includes tools for
 - Mesh operators (matrices) for mutual inductance, laplacian/resistance and gradient
 - Magnetic field of current density on a mesh.
 - Coil design 
 - Thermal noise simulation 
 - Spherical harmonics representation of data.
 - Magnetic field of wire segments

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For now, documentation is limited to function docstrings and comments. Some examples showcasing functionality are also included in the examples-folder.


Installing bfieldtools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic setuptools workflow applies.

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py build
    
.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

*When installing an evolving piece of software as a package, take care where you install, which version etc.*
