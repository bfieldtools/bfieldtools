bfieldtools is a set of tools for magnetic field modelling with emphasis on magnetic field generated by continuous surface current density. The surface current density is decribed by a piecewise linear stream function on a triangle mesh.

The toolbox currently includes tools for
 - Mesh operators (matrices) for mutual inductance, laplacian/resistance and gradient
 - Magnetic field of current density on a mesh.
 - Coil design 
 - Thermal noise simulation 
 - Spherical harmonics representation of data.
 - Magnetic field of wire segments
